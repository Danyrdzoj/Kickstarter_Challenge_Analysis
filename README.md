## Overview of Project
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
The database displayed information on her entertainment works on a regular basis. It was separated into several categories and subcategories as needed. The database includes about 4,000 historical records
Louise had all of her work's details; nonetheless, it was critical that she had a more complete study of his plays, imported dates, and her success story. It was critical for them to use quantitative techniques to disseminate the information. A precise display of Louise's data would assist her in making the best decisions to fund her next plays.

### Purpose

The main goal of this analysis was to show you quantitatively and graphically 1) What is the behavior and trend of Louise´s entertainment works (primarily theater) and 
2) In addition to the works being classified as Successful / Failed / Canceled, make a second classification and grouping according to her goal.
It is critical that the analysis is carried out appropriately using mathematical and Excel methodologies so that the deployment of information is optimal and correct decisions can be made. The arrangement of the information using pivot tables enables for an accurate and simple to analyze analysis.

## Analysis and Challenges

In general, the conclusions can be stated as follows: of the more than 4,000 datasets that were initially available, around 1370 correspond to works that were performed in theater. The classification and grouping based on aims enabled them to understand the distribution of their works and where they fit in the analysis range, so the interpretation and future analysis will help to make better business decisions.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Louise wanted to know how theater outcomes performed on a monthly basis for the first analysis. Similarly, you may view its classification based on its success status: successful, unsuccessful, or canceled. 1370 of the 4,000 data points corresponded to plays that were performed in theaters and behaved as follows: 60% were regarded successful, 36% failed, and 2% were canceled. This was accomplished by the use of a horizontal analysis. For the first time Using a vertical analysis, it was discovered that the busiest months for theater activity were May, June, and July. This analysis was carried out in the following manner: First, the dates were determined, and then a pivot table was created in another Excel tab, with the filters restricted to only theaters. The columns represent the distinctive information of successful, failed, or cancelled, while the lines display the months.
To depict the two studies, both vertical and horizontal, a graph called Theater results by launch date was created, in which you can see all of the behavior of the plays throughout the months' seasonalities.
